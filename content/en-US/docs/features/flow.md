# Flow Starter

## Flow Concept
Flow is a more generalized concept for business processes.

Relationship:
Flow > BP = Workflow > BPMN

Expression Engine is mainly used to solve data computation problems, implementing a calculation engine such as
QLExpress. BPMN scenarios are better suited to workflow or rule engines like Flowable. For example, Flowable
integrates JUEL to support simple expression parsing. DMN rule engines are better for true/false decision scenarios,
for example, the sequenceFlow routing conditions in BP. Drools focuses more on rule configuration and management.

Example scenarios:
- Import: better suited to BPMN. Each action is a data update node; actions have an order but can be processed
  asynchronously.
- Approval: BPMN + DMN. BPMN handles the approval process and path. DMN handles complex approval routing. DQL
  solves complex approver queries.

`flow-starter` is Softa's metadata-driven flow engine starter. It covers:

- design-time graph documents for a visual editor
- compile-time validation and transformation into runtime bundles
- published bundle revisions by `designId`
- runtime execution for process, validation, and compute flows
- persistent projections for instances, approval tasks, approval records, delegations, CC rules, and trigger events
- optional Pulsar-based trigger and async-task integration

This page documents the current backend contract implemented in `flow-starter`.

## Current Model

### Design, Publish, Runtime

| Layer | Main types | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Design time | `DesignFlowDefinition`, `FlowGraphDocument`, `FlowGraphNode`, `FlowGraphEdge` | Editor-facing graph DTOs |
| Publish time | `FlowCompiler`, `CompiledFlowDefinition`, `FlowPublishService` | Compile, validate, publish revisions, rollback |
| Runtime | `FlowRuntimeEngine`, `FlowExecutionState` | Execute published bundles, suspend/resume, persist projections |

### Flow Identity And Revisions

- `FlowDesign` is the draft working copy.
- `FlowBundle` is the compiled published snapshot.
- Published revisions are keyed by `designId`, not by `flowCode`.
- `FlowStartRequest` resolves bundles in this order:
  1. `bundleId` — pin to an exact published revision
  2. `designId` — start the current active revision
- To start a specific historical revision, look up its `bundleId` via the revisions listing endpoint and pass that as `bundleId`.
- `FlowBundle.designJson` keeps the design snapshot used at publish time so the editor can restore a historical canvas.

### Flow Scenarios

The module now uses a single `FlowScenario` enum instead of the old `FlowKind + FlowPurpose` split.

| Scenario | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `PROCESS` | Stateful runtime flow with persisted instances; covers both approval-style and automation-style flows |
| `VALIDATION` | Stateless synchronous validation flow — evaluated transiently: no instance row, no trace, no event log |
| `COMPUTE` | Stateless synchronous compute/onchange flow — evaluated transiently, same zero-footprint rules |

The scenario decides the execution strategy: `PROCESS` flows go through `FlowRuntimeEngine.start`
(persisted, resumable); `VALIDATION` / `COMPUTE` flows go through `evaluate` — the same traversal
with zero flow footprint. Business writes made by task nodes still join the caller's transaction,
so a failed evaluation rolls them back.

### Node Types

Current `FlowNodeType` values:

- Control: `Start`, `End`, `Timer`
- Routing: `InclusiveGateway`, `ParallelFork`, `ParallelJoin`
- Human: `Approval`, `HumanTask`*
- Task: `Script`, `CreateRecord`, `GetRecord`, `UpdateRecord`, `DeleteRecord`, `QueryRecords`, `ValidateData`, `Transform`, `CallService`, `CallWebhook`, `SendEmail`, `SendSms`, `SendInboxNotification`, `QueryAI`, `AsyncTask`, `GenerateFile`
- Subflow: `Subflow`
- Data: `ForEach`*, `ReturnValue`

\* `HumanTask` and `ForEach` are defined but **not yet runtime-supported**: they are omitted
from the node palette and rejected at compile time (`UNSUPPORTED_NODE_TYPE`), so a flow
containing them cannot publish.

Node-behavior invariants:

- **`Subflow` is synchronous-only**: the orchestrator fails the parent if a child
  enters a waiting state (`WAITING_APPROVAL` / `TIMER` / `ASYNC`), and recursive
  subflow invocation is rejected. Model human steps in the parent flow, not a child.
- **`ParallelFork` branches execute serially** (deterministic order), not
  wall-clock-parallel — the gateway models routing topology, not concurrency.

### Runtime Statuses

Defined `FlowExecutionStatus` values:

- `Pending`
- `Running`
- `Waiting` — parked on one or more waits (a pending approval and/or timer / async callback). The
  specific reasons live in the instance's pending-approval list and wait-token list, so a single
  status covers parallel branches suspended for different reasons at once.
- `Rejected`
- `Returned`
- `Withdrawn`
- `Cancelled`
- `Completed`
- `Failed`

## API Overview

Host applications embedding the engine in-process should integrate through the
`FlowClient` facade (`io.softa.starter.flow.api`) rather than looping back over
REST — actor / initiator / tenant identity is always resolved server-side from the
context, never passed as call parameters. See the in-module integration guide under `starters/flow-starter/docs/integration-guide.md` in the Softa source repository.

### Design APIs (flow editor)

Base path: `/flow/designs` — the dedicated surface for the graphical editor
(the full editor API contract lives in the Softa source repository under `starters/flow-starter/docs/frontend-editor-api.md`).
The generic model API at `/FlowDesign/**` remains available as the platform
data plane and is intentionally not intercepted.

| Method | Path | Description |

| `POST` | `/flow/designs/{id}/save` | Auto-save the canvas; stale versions are rejected |
| `POST` | `/flow/designs/{id}/delete` | Delete a draft if it has never been published |
| `POST` | `/flow/designs/{id}/duplicate` | Copy a draft under a fresh flow code |

| `POST` | `/flow/designs/{id}/restore?bundleId=` | Restore the draft canvas from a historical bundle snapshot |
| `GET` | `/flow/designs/{id}/status` | Publish status: revision badge + dirty flag |
| `GET` | `/flow/designs/{id}/availableVariables?nodeId=` | Variables visible to a node (expression autocomplete) |
| `POST` | `/flow/designs/{id}/debugRun` | Compile and run the current draft as a debug bundle (not a sandbox) |
| `GET` | `/flow/designs/{id}/debugRuns` | Debug-run history, newest first |

### Bundle APIs (published revisions)

Base path: `/flow/bundles`

| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/flow/bundles?designId=` | Revision list of one design (or every design's active bundle without `designId`) |
| `GET` | `/flow/bundles/{bundleId}?include=design` | One revision's summary, optionally with the canvas-complete design snapshot |
| `POST` | `/flow/bundles/{bundleId}/activate` | Make this revision the design's effective one (rollback = roll-forward) |

### Node Descriptor APIs

Base path: `/flow/nodeDescriptors`

| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/flow/nodeDescriptors` | List all node descriptors for the editor palette |
| `GET` | `/flow/nodeDescriptors?scenario=PROCESS` | Filter descriptors by `FlowScenario` |

### Runtime APIs

Base path: `/flow/runtime`

| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/flow/runtime/instances/start` | Start a flow instance |
| `GET` | `/flow/runtime/instances/{instanceId}?includeTrace=` | Get one runtime instance (trace excluded by default) |
| `GET` | `/flow/runtime/instances/{instanceId}/overlay` | Per-node run state for canvas painting |
| `GET` | `/flow/runtime/instances/{instanceId}/trace?sinceSequence=` | Incremental trace rows for polling |
| `POST` | `/flow/runtime/instances/search` | Paged summaries of the caller's own instances — the initiator filter is always the authenticated user (filters: flowCode/designId/status/model/row/createdFrom/createdTo) |
| `POST` | `/flow/runtime/instances/approve` | Approve a pending approval |
| `POST` | `/flow/runtime/instances/reject` | Reject a pending approval |
| `POST` | `/flow/runtime/instances/transfer` | Transfer a pending approval task |
| `POST` | `/flow/runtime/instances/delegate` | Delegate a pending approval task |
| `POST` | `/flow/runtime/instances/add-sign-before` | Insert a prerequisite signer |
| `POST` | `/flow/runtime/instances/add-sign-after` | Insert a follow-up signer |

| `POST` | `/flow/runtime/trigger` | Fire a trigger event and start matching flows |
| `POST` | `/flow/runtime/onchange` | Run `COMPUTE` flows transiently and return variable diffs |
| `POST` | `/flow/runtime/validate` | Run `VALIDATION` flows transiently against candidate row data; returns each flow's declared outputs keyed by flow code |

Engine-internal resume callbacks live on `/internal/flow/runtime/instances/{resumeAsync|resumeTimer}`
(INTERNAL identity scope) — they are not part of the user-facing surface.

`actorId` / `initiatorId` / `tenantId` are **never** sent by clients: every action
request stamps them server-side from the login context (`@JsonProperty(READ_ONLY)`),
and all query endpoints resolve the current actor from the context.

## Approval Projection APIs

### Approval Tasks

Base path: `/flow/approvalTasks`

| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/flow/approvalTasks/counts` | Inbox badge counts for the current actor (`{pendingApprovals, unreadCc}` — same filter definitions as the paged `/pending` and `/cc?read=false` queries) |
| `GET` | `/flow/approvalTasks/pending?flowCode=&instanceId=&nodeId=&pageNumber=&pageSize=` | Pending tasks for the current actor (paged: returns `Page`) |
| `GET` | `/flow/approvalTasks/completed?flowCode=&instanceId=&nodeId=&pageNumber=&pageSize=` | Completed tasks for the current actor (paged) |
| `GET` | `/flow/approvalTasks/cc?read=&flowCode=&instanceId=&nodeId=&pageNumber=&pageSize=` | CC tasks for the current actor (paged; `read=false` unread, `read=true` acknowledged, omit `read` for both) |
| `GET` | `/flow/approvalTasks/inbox?flowCode=&instanceId=&nodeId=&includeCompletedApprovals=&pageNumber=&pageSize=` | Unified inbox view (pending approvals + CC; optional completed approvals) |
| `GET` | `/flow/approvalTasks/instance/{instanceId}` | All tasks for one runtime instance (participants / initiator only) |

### Approval Records

Base path: `/flow/approvalRecords`

| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/flow/approvalRecords/instance/{instanceId}` | Approval history by runtime instance |
| `GET` | `/flow/approvalRecords/history` | Actor-scoped approval history |
| `GET` | `/flow/approvalRecords/cc/sent` | Sender-side CC history |

### CC Config

Base path: `/flow/ccConfigs`

| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/flow/ccConfigs` | Create a CC rule |
| `GET` | `/flow/ccConfigs?flowCode=` | List CC rules by `flowCode` |
| `POST` | `/flow/ccConfigs/{id}/deactivate` | Deactivate a CC rule |

### Delegation

Base path: `/flow/delegations`

| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/flow/delegations` | Create a delegation rule |
| `GET` | `/flow/delegations/my` | Delegations created by the caller (delegator resolved from the login context) |
| `GET` | `/flow/delegations/to-me` | Active delegations assigned to the caller (delegate resolved from the login context) |
| `POST` | `/flow/delegations/{id}/cancel` | Cancel a delegation rule |

### Monitor

Base path: `/flow/monitor` — operator-facing; the search endpoint requires the system admin role (`@RequireRole(SystemRoleAdmin)`, fail-closed when the host app wires no role provider). A caller holding that role also bypasses the participant scoping on the instance detail / overlay / trace / approval-history reads.

| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/flow/monitor/health` | Flow runtime health snapshot (per-status instance counts, overdue timers) |
| `POST` | `/flow/monitor/instances/search` | Cross-initiator paged instance summaries; honors the request's `initiatorId` filter when present |

### Event Logs

Base path: `/flow/events`

| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/flow/events?flowCode=&sourceModel=&sourceRowId=&instanceId=&success=&eventTimeFrom=&eventTimeTo=&pageNumber=&pageSize=` | Paged event log, newest first (filters combine with AND; list rows exclude the parameters payload) |
| `GET` | `/flow/events/{id}` | Single event including the raw trigger-parameters payload |

## Approval Model

### Approval And Reject Thresholds

- Approval modes: `ANY_ONE`, `UNANIMOUS`, `MIN_COUNT`, `PERCENTAGE`
- Reject modes: `ANY_ONE`, `UNANIMOUS`, `MIN_COUNT`, `PERCENTAGE`
- One actor can only cast one effective vote per cycle.
- Compile-time validators reject impossible threshold combinations.

### Approver Resolution

Approval nodes support:

- static approvers via `config.approvers`
- dynamic approvers via `config.approverSource`
- empty-approver strategies via `config.emptyApproverStrategy`

Supported dynamic source types in the current default resolution path:

- `VariableList`
- `Expression`
- `InitiatorManager`
- `Role`

Important integration note:

- `OrganizationService` is defined as an SPI (`MetadataOrganizationService` is the default when wired). The default resolver path also supports variable-based sources via `ApproverResolutionService`.
- If you need real org-tree lookup, provide a custom `OrganizationService` bean or populate resolution variables such as `initiatorManagerId` and `roleApprovers` before the flow reaches the approval node.

Approver dedup: the default policy is **`GLOBAL`** — a user who already approved an
earlier node is auto-passed on later nodes (recorded as `AUTO_APPROVE`). Residual
risk: a mid-flow form edit is still auto-endorsed by that earlier approval; set the
policy to `CONTIGUOUS` or `NONE` on flows where a re-look matters.

### Additional Approval Actions

- transfer
- delegate
- add-sign-before
- add-sign-after
- cc
- read-cc
- return
- resubmit
- withdraw
- urge
- comment

### Timeout Handling

Approval timeout strategies:

- `REMIND`
- `AUTO_APPROVE`
- `AUTO_REJECT`
- `ESCALATE`

`ApprovalTimeoutScheduler` handles reminders, auto actions, and escalation against persisted pending approvals.

## Task Execution Model

Executor-backed task nodes use `TaskNodeConfig`. The node **`FlowNodeType`**
selects the executor — there is no separate `executor` field in config.

```json
{
  "input": {
    "to": ["{{ applicantEmail }}"],
    "subject": "Order {{ orderId }} confirmed",
    "htmlBody": "<h1>Thank you for your order!</h1>"
  },
  "outputVariable": "taskResult"
}
```

- `input` supports `{{ expr }}` interpolation; resolution is owned by the executor
  (type-aware for data executors, recursive interpolation for free-shape payloads)
- `options` is executor-specific
- `outputVariable`, when present, stores the raw executor result under one variable name

Every task node type has a **typed input config DTO** registered in `TaskConfigTypes`:
the compiler parses `config.input` into the DTO at publish time and rejects missing
required keys (`MISSING_REQUIRED_INPUT`), so a misconfigured node fails at publish
instead of mid-execution. `DefaultTaskExecutorRegistry` asserts at boot that every
registered executor's node type has such an entry.

### Bundled Task Executors

| Node type | Executor bean | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `CREATE_RECORD` | `CreateDataTaskExecutor` | Built in |
| `GET_RECORD` | `GetDataTaskExecutor` | Built in |
| `UPDATE_RECORD` | `UpdateDataTaskExecutor` | Built in |
| `DELETE_RECORD` | `DeleteDataTaskExecutor` | Built in |
| `QUERY_RECORDS` | `QueryRecordsTaskExecutor` | Built in; opt-out via `flow.task.builtin.query-records.enabled=false` to register a custom executor |
| `VALIDATE_DATA` | `ValidateDataTaskExecutor` | Built in |
| `TRANSFORM` | `ExtractTransformTaskExecutor` | Built in |
| `CALL_WEBHOOK` | `WebHookTaskExecutor` | Built in |
| `CALL_SERVICE` | `CallServiceTaskExecutor` | **Disabled by default**. Opt-in via `flow.task.builtin.call-service.enabled=true`; a non-empty `flow.task.call-service.allow-list` of permitted bean-name prefixes is then mandatory |
| `SEND_EMAIL` | `SendEmailTaskExecutor` | Registered only when `MessageService` is available |
| `SEND_SMS` | `SendSmsTaskExecutor` | Registered only when `MessageService` is available |
| `SEND_INBOX_NOTIFICATION` | `SendInboxNotificationTaskExecutor` | Registered only when `MessageService` is available |
| `QUERY_AI` | `QueryAiTaskExecutor` | Registered only when `AiRobotService` is available |
| `ASYNC_TASK` | `AsyncTaskExecutor` | Registered only when `FlowAsyncTaskProducer` is available |
| `GENERATE_FILE` | `GenerateFileTaskExecutor` | Registered only when `DocumentTemplateService` (file-starter) is available |

Current module notes:

- `CALL_SERVICE` ships a bundled executor but is **disabled by default**: it invokes an arbitrary Spring bean method by name, so it must be explicitly enabled and given a non-empty bean-name allow-list.

## Trigger And Messaging Integration

Supported trigger sources (`TriggerSource` sealed sub-types):

- `EntityChange`
- `Api`
- `Cron`
- `Subflow`
- `FieldChange` (COMPUTE scenario only)

Pulsar-connected components are conditionally registered:

| Property | Component | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `mq.topics.flow-event.topic` | `FlowEventProducer`, `FlowEventConsumer` | Async trigger fire and consume |
| `mq.topics.flow-async-task.topic` | `FlowAsyncTaskProducer`, `FlowAsyncTaskConsumer` | Async task dispatch and callback resume |
| `mq.topics.change-log.topic` | `ChangeLogFlowConsumer` | Entity change driven flow triggers |
| `mq.topics.cron-task.topic` | `CronTaskFlowConsumer` | Cron-driven flow triggers |
| `mq.topics.flow-timer.topic` | `FlowTimerConsumer` | Timer wake-up consume side |

Important timer note:

- The module includes the timer resume consumer.
- A scheduler or producer that publishes `FlowTimerMessage` still has to be provided by the host application or another integration module.

## Persistence Model

| Entity | Description |
|---|---|
| `FlowDesign` | Draft working copy |
| `FlowBundle` | Published compiled bundle |
| `FlowInstance` | Persisted runtime instance state (trace and approval history are NOT embedded — see the two dedicated tables) |
| `FlowExecutionTrace` | Append-only execution trace rows (the in-memory state keeps only the current attempt's delta) |
| `FlowApprovalTask` | Pending/completed/CC task projections |
| `FlowApprovalRecord` | Approval action audit ledger — the authoritative approval history, flushed by the instance store in the same transaction as the instance row |
| `FlowCcConfig` | Automatic CC rules |
| `FlowDelegation` | Delegation rules |
| `FlowEvent` | Trigger event logs |
| `FlowDebugHistory` | Debug snapshots |
| `FlowParallelBranch` | Parallel branch tracking |

Primary storage adapters in this module:

- `OrmFlowBundleRegistry`
- `OrmFlowInstanceStore`

## Node Descriptor Contract

The editor palette is built from `FlowNodeDescriptor` records exposed through `/flow/nodeDescriptors`.

- structural descriptors come from `BuiltinNodeDescriptorProvider`
- executor-backed task descriptors come from `TaskExecutorDescriptorProvider`
- descriptors include label, icon, sort order, config schema, default config, and allowed scenarios

`TaskExecutorDescriptorProvider` only exposes task nodes for executors that are actually registered as Spring beans, so conditional executors such as `QUERY_AI` and `ASYNC_TASK` only appear when their dependencies are present.

## Frontend Graph Compatibility

Design graph DTOs remain aligned with xyflow/react style structures:

| xyflow/react | flow-starter |
|---|---|
| `Node.id` | `FlowGraphNode.id` |
| `Node.type` | `FlowGraphNode.type` |
| `Node.position` | `FlowGraphNode.position` |
| `Node.width` / `height` | `FlowGraphNode.width` / `height` |
| `Node.data` | `FlowGraphNode.data` |
| `Edge.id` | `FlowGraphEdge.id` |
| `Edge.source` / `target` | `FlowGraphEdge.source` / `target` |
| `Edge.sourceHandle` / `targetHandle` | `FlowGraphEdge.sourceHandle` / `targetHandle` |
| `Edge.type` | `FlowGraphEdge.type` |
| `Edge.label` | `FlowGraphEdge.label` |
| `Edge.data` | `FlowGraphEdge.data` |
| `Viewport {x, y, zoom}` | `FlowGraphViewport {x, y, zoom}` |

## Host Application Integration Checklist

Before enabling `flow-starter` in a real app, verify:

- add `flow-starter` to the application classpath
- create and expose `FlowDesign` drafts through the generic model APIs
- provide a real `ApprovalNotificationService` if you need email, SMS, IM, or in-app notifications
- provide a custom `OrganizationService` or populate approver resolution variables if you need manager/role/department based approvers
- enable Pulsar topics if using triggers or async tasks
- provide timer scheduling/publishing if using `TIMER` nodes
- enable `CALL_SERVICE` explicitly (plus its bean-name allow-list) if flows need to invoke Spring beans; all other task node types ship working executors, conditionally registered on their capability beans
