# About Softa

Softa is a **metadata-driven, enterprise-grade application framework** with built-in AI integration and interaction building blocks. We design it for teams who need to ship business systems that are **secure, strict, and able to evolve sustainably**.

## What Softa is

- **A framework for real enterprise apps**: it packages the common platform capabilities you repeatedly rebuild (security, metadata governance, workflows, integration, etc.).
- **Open-source, community-driven**: we follow *Build in public, build in community*—decisions and evolution happen in the open.
- **More than a framework over time**: a key milestone is **open-sourcing applications** built on top of Softa, so the ecosystem grows with real-world apps.

## What problem we solve

Enterprise systems don’t fail because “CRUD is hard”—they fail because **governance, security, change management, and cross-system integration** become unmanageable as complexity grows.

Softa reduces repeated plumbing and helps you keep consistency across UI, APIs, automation, and data rules—without giving up guardrails.

## Core capabilities (high level)

- **Metadata-driven foundation**: unify model/field/UI abstractions, with versioning and multi-environment publishing.
- **Flow automation**: approvals, scheduled jobs, and AI-assisted operations as first-class building blocks.
- **OpenAPI-first integration**: clear, standard documentation and an API style that’s easier for both humans and AI agents to use.
- **Security & privacy by design**: ABAC, row/field-level permissions, encryption & masking, and audit-friendly change logs.
- **Integration and orchestration**: configurable integrations with common authentication patterns.
- **Timeline model**: query effective data by date and track business events consistently.
- **i18n and SaaS readiness**: multi-locale UX, multi-tenancy patterns, and mainstream relational database support.

## Who it’s for

- Teams building **medium to large** business systems
- Organizations that need **fine-grained security governance**
- Products that must support **multi-tenant** and/or **multi-locale** requirements
- Developers who want to integrate with other systems via **standard OpenAPI**
